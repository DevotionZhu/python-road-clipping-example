    "# Python road clipping example\n",

    "This is an example of how to use Python's geospatial tools to clip a shapefile of roads into segments using a polygon layer. It was developed during research for the March 16, 2018, _Los Angeles Times_ story [\"Out of Control: The deadly toll of street racing in Los Angeles.\"](https://github.com/datadesk/street-racing-analysis/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) but never finalized for publication. It is presented here an experiment for others to consider and improve.\n",
